SUPERMARKET SYSTEM

OVERVIEW
The problem tackled in this project is "Retail billing system" using solely python as a programming tool. Here, I have utilised python to create a top-down model of a database using  dictionaries, lists and python libraries to help with the aforementioned database.

FEATURES
1. Completely user defined database and user inputted values.
2. The database act as a  checkout machine at supermarket stores in which a user can generate it’s own bill  by itself.
3. Simple Top-Down Design.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Python
2. Python Libraries

STEPS TO INSTALL AND RUN
1. Confirm the same version of Python as used in the project.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you want the project to reside.
4. Use the command: 
5.Running Python code often requires a controlled environment to ensure compatibility. Use tools like virtualenv or conda to isolate the project dependencies.
6. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script you want to run.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING
1.	Check Menu : Use 1 to see the prices.
2.	 Make a Sale: Enter 2 to shop. Add a few items (like MILK), then type CHECKOUT. Check that the final bill total is correct.
3.	Invalid Input: Try entering a product name that is not on the list (e.g., GUM). The system must ask you to try again.

4.	Payment Check: Pay the bill. First, enter the wrong amount to see the error message. Then, enter the exact correct amount to finish the sale.

5.	The system will automatically generate a graph for the purchased items.
